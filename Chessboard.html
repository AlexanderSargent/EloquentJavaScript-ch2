  /*Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using
  newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is
  either a space or a “#” character. The characters should form a chess board.

  Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

   # # # #
  # # # #
   # # # #
  # # # #
   # # # #
  # # # #
   # # # #
  # # # #
  When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a variable
  size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a
  grid of the given width and height. */

  /*Chessboard. Here I replaced the empty spaces with [] to try to make it a
  little closer to looking like a board. Added a user prompt instead of
  requiring a manual switch of the variable 'size', and a basic check for
  valid numbers.*/

  /*Here I begin creating the board. As I create a new line, I determine whether
  the row is even or odd, as even rows start with a space, while odds start with
  a #. I then run through the row upping the count everytime a new character is
  inserted, breaking when the the column count(across) is equal to the desired size.
  This is repeated until the row count(down) is also equal to size.*/
