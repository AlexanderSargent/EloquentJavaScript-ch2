# EloquentJavaScript-ch2
My solutions to the three example problems in Chapter 2 of Eloquent JavaScript, by Marijn Haverbeke. Fizzbuzz, creating triangles, 
and creating a chessboard. 

Eloquent JavaScript can be found here: http://eloquentjavascript.net/ 

I am getting back into JavaScript, hoping to get into Node.js and Angular.js, and trying to make a career change into programming.

Any feedback for helping me improve my code is greatly appreciated!
